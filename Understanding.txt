In the code you've been working with, the lines that specifically represent the fine-tuning of the SciBERT model and the training of the newly added layers are as follows:

Adding the Task-Specific Layers
python
Copy code
# Fine-tuning SciBERT as a classifier
class SciBERTClassifier(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, bert_model, num_labels=2):
        super(SciBERTClassifier, self).__init__()
        self.bert = bert_model
        self.dropout = torch.nn.Dropout(0.3)
        self.classifier = torch.nn.Linear(self.bert.config.hidden_size, num_labels)
    
    def forward(self, input_ids, attention_mask):
        outputs = self.bert(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        cls_output = outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]  # CLS token output
        cls_output = self.dropout(cls_output)
        logits = self.classifier(cls_output)
        return logits
What it does:
self.dropout adds a dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
self.classifier adds a linear layer that maps the CLS token output (from SciBERT) to the number of classes (in this case, 2 for binary classification).
Initializing the Model for Fine-Tuning
python
Copy code
model = SciBERTClassifier(model).to(device)
What it does: This line creates an instance of the SciBERTClassifier class, which includes both the pre-trained SciBERT model and the new task-specific layers (dropout and classifier). By sending it to device, it prepares the model to run on either a GPU or CPU.
Fine-Tuning (Training the Model)
python
Copy code
for epoch in range(epochs):
    model.train()
    total_loss = 0
    for batch in tqdm(train_loader):
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        input_ids = batch['input_ids'].to(device)
        attention_mask = batch['attention_mask'].to(device)
        labels = batch['labels'].to(device)

        logits = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)
        loss = torch.nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=torch.tensor([pos_weight]).to(device))(logits, labels.float().unsqueeze(1))
        total_loss += loss.item()

        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    avg_loss = total_loss / len(train_loader)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch + 1}/{epochs} - Loss: {avg_loss:.4f}')
What it does:
model.train(): Puts the model in training mode, so layers like dropout behave appropriately.
logits = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask): Passes the input data through the model, including the pre-trained SciBERT layers and the new classifier layer.
loss.backward(): Computes the gradients, which propagate back through the network.
optimizer.step(): Updates the weights of both the SciBERT layers and the new classifier layer based on the computed gradients.
Summary
Lines that Define the Model Architecture: The SciBERTClassifier class where the new layers are defined.
Lines that Involve Fine-Tuning: The loop over epochs where the model is trained (loss.backward() and optimizer.step()), fine-tuning the pre-trained layers along with the newly added ones.

What are input id's and attention masks
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
In the context of Transformer models like SciBERT, input IDs and attention masks are essential components that help the model understand and process the input text.

1. Input IDs
What They Are: Input IDs are numerical representations of the input text. They correspond to the tokenized words or subwords in the text.
How They're Generated: The tokenizer converts each word (or subword) in the text into a unique integer (ID) from its vocabulary. For example, in SciBERT, the word "science" might be tokenized and assigned a specific ID, say 1234.
Special Tokens:
[CLS]: A special token added at the beginning of the input to represent the entire sentence or sequence.
[SEP]: A token used to separate sentences, especially in tasks involving pairs of sentences.
[PAD]: Padding tokens added to the sequence so that all input sequences in a batch are of the same length.
Example: The sentence "Hello world" might be tokenized into [101, 7592, 2088, 102], where 101 might represent [CLS], 7592 for "Hello", 2088 for "world", and 102 for [SEP].
2. Attention Masks
What They Are: Attention masks are binary masks that indicate which tokens should be attended to by the model and which should be ignored (e.g., padding tokens).
How They're Used: In each layer of the transformer, the model calculates attention scores. The attention mask helps the model focus on the meaningful parts of the input and ignore the padded parts.
Values:
1 indicates that the token should be attended to (it's a real token from the input text).
0 indicates that the token should be ignored (it's a padding token).
How They Work Together
When feeding text into SciBERT, the tokenizer outputs both input IDs and attention masks. The input IDs tell the model what words are in the input text, and the attention mask helps the model focus only on the actual words, not the padding added for batching purposes.

Example in Practice
Letâ€™s say we have two sentences:

Sentence 1: "Hello world"
Sentence 2: "Hi"
After tokenization, they might look like:

Sentence 1: [101, 7592, 2088, 102, 0, 0] (with padding [0, 0] to make both sentences the same length)
Sentence 2: [101, 7632, 102, 0, 0, 0]
Corresponding attention masks would be:

Sentence 1: [1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
Sentence 2: [1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
This setup ensures that the model processes both sentences correctly without being confused by the padding tokens.
